TODOs:
    Add GUI tasks here.

    ☐ Add dropdown where you can select serial port
        If no serial port is selected, the serial reading should be disbled
    ☐ Change so that we only read serial when there is something new to read
        Ser.in_waiting returns the number of bytes in the recieve buffer
        This could be used to achieve what we want
    ☐ Implement a new serial interface where we can read more than the direction...
        This is a bigger task
        We first have to decide on the platform side of it how we want to send stuff.
        We should probably implement some type of packet based communication
    ☐ Implement console window
        ☐ There should be a line where you can write commands to send to the robot
        ☐ Above the command line there should be a history of previously sent commands
        ☐ It should be possible to access previously sent commands by using the arrow keys while the command line is chosen
        ☐ The command line should be below the history
        ☐ The text size should be consant, but the number of lines visible in the history should be dependent on the main window size
