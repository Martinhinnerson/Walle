TODOs:
    Add GUI tasks here.

    ☐ Add dropdown where you can select serial port
        If no serial port is selected, the serial reading should be disbled
    ☐ Change so that we only read serial when there is something new to read
        Ser.in_waiting returns the number of bytes in the recieve buffer
        This could be used to achieve what we want
    ☐ Implement a new serial interface where we can read more than the direction...
        This is a bigger task
        We first have to decide on the platform side of it how we want to send stuff.
        We should probably implement some type of packet based communication

  ✔ Variable 'ser' is global, move to main class or status class? @done(18-11-09 22:27) @project(TODOs)
  ✔ Make the serial values printable in the GUI @done(18-11-09 21:03) @project(TODOs)
    Right now I can print to the terminal but can't manage to convert the input to the
    correct datatype because i suck at python...
