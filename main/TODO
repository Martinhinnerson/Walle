TODOs:
  Add various todos here
  ☐ Add serial communication support to talk to the WIFI module
    the wifi module will talk to the computer and both recieve and send data
  ☐ Emigrate the code to the Arduino Mega
    ☐ The cppm library might have to be customized to support the mega
  ☐ Add accelerometer/gyro/magnetometer to the platform
    Mainly to be able to control direction
    This will probably be done using a gy-80
  ☐ Test the new class implementation of the platform and the radio
    The code compiles but is not tested
  Implement proximity sensors
    ☐ Test the mini LIDAR
    ☐ Test the sharp IR sensor
    ☐ Create linear interpolation and calibrate the sensor data
      The sensors won't give linearly increasing values with distance
  ☐ Add different modes for the platform
    For examle manual, automatic driving, lidar sensor mode etc.
    This will basically be a state machine in the platform class.
  ☐ Comment already created code.. @project(TODOs) @started(18-11-07 09:41)

  ✔ Change motor handling so that it doesn't have to be driven with cppm @started(18-11-05 18:56) @done(18-11-06 19:11) @lasted(1d15m56s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that the motors can be driven in an easy way during autonomous drive
  ✔ Move the radio class into the platform @started(18-11-06 14:11) @done(18-11-06 18:57) @lasted(4h46m45s) @project(TODOs)
    The radio is right now separate using global variables
  ✔ Make the platform into a class @started(18-11-06 11:51) @done(18-11-06 12:34) @lasted(43m29s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that we can store speed, direction etc in the class
