TODOs:
  Add various todos here

  ☐ Add serial communication support to talk to the WIFI module
    the wifi module will talk to the computer and both recieve and send data
  ☐ Emigrate the code to the Arduino Mega
    ☐ The cppm library might have to be customized to support the mega
  ☐ Change motor handling so that it doesn't have to be driven with cppm @started(18-11-05 18:56)
    This is so that the motors can be driven in an easy way during autonomous drive
  ☐ Add accelerometer/gyro to the platform
    Mainly to be able to control direction
    This will probably be done using a mpu6050
  ☐ Test the new class implementation of the platform
    The code compiles but is not tested
  ☐ Move the radio class into the platform
    The radio is right now separate using global variables

  ✔ Make the platform into a class @started(18-11-06 11:51) @done(18-11-06 12:34) @lasted(43m29s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that we can store speed, direction etc in the class
