TODOs:
  Add various todos here
  Communication:
  ☐ Add serial communication support to talk to the WIFI module
    the wifi module will talk to the computer and both recieve and send data
  ☐ Create a communication protocol/class for sending sensor data
    It would be nice to have one unit controlling gathering and sending of the sendor data
  
  Platform:
  ☐ Emigrate the code to the Arduino Mega
    ☐ The cppm library might have to be customized to support the mega
  ☐ Add accelerometer/gyro to the platform
    These two might not be that neccesary so the priority is not that high
  ☐ Implement proximity sensors
    ☐ Test the mini LIDAR
    ☐ Test the sharp IR sensor
    ☐ Create linear interpolation and calibrate the sensor data
      The sensors won't give linearly increasing values with distance
  ☐ Add different modes for the platform
    For examle manual, automatic driving, lidar sensor mode etc.
    This will basically be a state machine in the platform class.
  ☐ Implement a timer class that can keep track of timers
    This can be usefull if we want to do certain tasks only once in a while
    like for example reading a sensor or sending the sensor value to the GUI
  ☐ Implement the stepper motor for the lidar system
    It will be controlled with an H-bridge and probably the accelStepper library
  ☐ Implement the sound card to bea able to play sounds
    The one we have is a Adafruit Mini Audio FX board 16Mb
  ☐ Add an LCD screen for information, status, mode etc.
    The one we have is a BT21605AV which uses I2C communication
  ☐ Make it so that the radio reciever is diabled if the controller is not turned on
    Right now if the controller is not on when the platform is on weird things can happen
    The platform should be able to sense when there is not radio signals being recieved

  PID:
    ☐ Add support for wraparound
    in the case of eg. the rotation 0-360
    ☐ If a PID controller should be used a solution for integrator saturation has to be implemented
    ☐ Discrete controler -> Time, T_s, between each measurement has to be decided
    
  Others:
    ☐ Comment already created code.. @project(TODOs) @started(18-11-07 09:41)
      ☐ Use "/* some text */" to comment what functions do
    This is a stupid task and it should be done when the code is written...

Archive:
  ✔ Create PID class so that we can create and use PID controllers for the platform @started(18-11-10 12:44) @done(18-11-10 13:18) @lasted(34m31s) @project(TODOs)
    The first one i want is one that rotates the robot to a certain heading and uses the compass as the feedback
  ✔ Test the new class implementation of the platform and the radio @done(18-11-10 11:25) @project(TODOs)
    The code compiles but is not tested
  ✔ Implement the GY-85 Magnetometer in a class @started(18-11-09 22:22) @done(18-11-09 22:22) @lasted(29s) @project(TODOs)
  ✔ Embedd the sensor data in a good way to be able to send it easy @started(18-11-09 21:22) @done(18-11-09 22:22) @lasted(1h44s) @project(TODOs)
    Should we send chars/int/double/float?
  ✔ Change motor handling so that it doesn't have to be driven with cppm @started(18-11-05 18:56) @done(18-11-06 19:11) @lasted(1d15m56s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that the motors can be driven in an easy way during autonomous drive
  ✔ Move the radio class into the platform @started(18-11-06 14:11) @done(18-11-06 18:57) @lasted(4h46m45s) @project(TODOs)
    The radio is right now separate using global variables
  ✔ Make the platform into a class @started(18-11-06 11:51) @done(18-11-06 12:34) @lasted(43m29s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that we can store speed, direction etc in the class
