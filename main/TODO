TODOs:
  Add various todos here

  ☐ Emigrate the code to the Arduino Mega @started(18-11-21 10:06)
    ☐ The cppm library might have to be customized to support the mega @started(18-11-21 10:06)
      I beleive the library works now but it has to be tested
  ☐ Implement the stepper motor for the lidar system @started(18-11-25 11:10)
    It will be controlled with an H-bridge and probably the accelStepper library
    ☐ Implement the AccelStepper library @started(18-11-25 11:14)
      This is a nice library for handling stepper motors with accurate acceleration, speed and step.
  ☐ Make it so that the radio reciever is diabled if the controller is not turned on
    Right now if the controller is not on when the platform is on weird things can happen
    The platform should be able to sense when there is not radio signals being recieved
  ☐ Implement the sound card to bea able to play sounds
    The one we have is a Adafruit Mini Audio FX board 16Mb
  ☐ Add an LCD screen for information, status, mode etc.
    The one we have is a BT21605AV which uses I2C communication
  ☐ Add software interupt support using Timer in the timer class
    Right now the class only has "manual" timers not using interrupts.
    The MEGA has a few Timers that can to interrupts and these can be used for the most important timings
    eg. maybe the PID loops.
  ☐ It would be nice to have a text file (JSON maybe?) that defines the communication protocol
    This all the units (UI, platform etc. ) can load this file to know what the different commands should interpret to
    instead of having to sync the commands manually. Eg. if we change one command on one of the unit it also has to be changed
    in all other files instead of only having to change it in one place.
  ☐ Add functions for the lidar sensor control
    ☐ Add functions for control of the rotation with the stepper motor
    ☐ Add functions for angle control of the the sensor with the servo

  Communication:
    ☐ Create a communication protocol/class for sending sensor data
      It would be nice to have one unit controlling gathering and sending of the sendor data
    ☐ Add the WIFI module and implement TCP protocol (not priority)
      the wifi module will talk to the computer and both recieve and send data

  Sensors:
    ☐ Implement the TFmini on the arduino MEGA
    The TFmini is connected to the I2c bus. So is the Magnetometer. There should not be a problem
    since both are slaves but we have to make sure this is the case.
    ☐ Implement proximity sensors
      ☐ Test the sharp IR sensor
    ☐ Create linear interpolation and calibrate the sensor data
    The sensors won't give linearly increasing values with distance
    ☐ Add accelerometer/gyro to the platform
    These two might not be that neccesary so the priority is not that high
      
  PID:
    ☐ If a PID controller should be used a solution for integrator saturation has to be implemented
    ☐ Discrete controler -> Time, T_s, between each measurement has to be decided
    
  Others:
    ☐ Comment already created code.. @project(TODOs) @started(18-11-07 09:41)
      ☐ Use "/* some text */" to comment what functions do
    This is a stupid task and it should be done when the code is written...

  ✔ Change the pinmap for the arduino mega in settings.h @done(18-12-08 16:06) @project(TODOs)
    Currently it is just the same as the UNO
  ✔ Add a bluetooth module with passthrough for the serial out @done(18-12-08 16:07) @project(TODOs.Communication)
    This should not be the same serial as the one used to debug
  ✘ Implement the PacketSerial library @started(18-11-21 19:14) @cancelled(18-11-29 11:20) @wasted(1w16h6m57s) @project(TODOs.Communication)

  ✘ Implement COBS @cancelled(18-11-29 11:21) @project(TODOs.Communication)
    https://pythonhosted.org/cobs/cobs.cobs.html#cobs-examples
  ✔ Fix so that the timers work for the arduino Mega @started(18-11-21 18:25) @done(18-11-21 18:25) @lasted(57s) @project(TODOs.Sensors)
    Right now the arduino crashes at startup either when initializing the timers or the first time they are set.
    This could have to do with timers on the MEGA2560 being different than the UNO
    It could also be because of a collision with the jmCPPM library that i modified to support the MEGA
  ✔ Add support for wraparound @done(18-11-20 14:05) @project(TODOs.PID)
    in the case of eg. the rotation 0-360
  ✔ Add different modes for the platform @done(18-11-12 09:53) @project(TODOs)
    For examle manual, automatic driving, lidar sensor mode etc.
    This will basically be a state machine in the platform class.
  ✔ Fix the problem with not being able to use non-static member functions in callbacks @started(18-11-12 09:03) @done(18-11-12 09:04) @lasted(1m1s) @project(TODOs.Timer)
    There is currently a big problem with this class.
    Right now the callback function has to be static which means that 
    if it is not global (which it should not be) the callback function cannot use any
    private member variable or functions (which most of them do...).alignas
    One solution to this is to implement boost:: which allows non-static member functions
    in a callback. https://github.com/vancegroup/arduino-boost
    Could the timers be handled without callback functions?
    SOLUTION, I remade the timer class so that they dont have callback functions.
    Instead you now check the timers in that platform and run functions conditionally
  ✔ Test the mini LIDAR @done(18-11-11 19:56) @project(TODOs)
  ✔ Implement a timer class that can keep track of timers @started(18-11-11 20:38) @done(18-11-11 20:38) @lasted(31s) @project(TODOs)
    This can be usefull if we want to do certain tasks only once in a while
    like for example reading a sensor or sending the sensor value to the GUI
  ✔ Create PID class so that we can create and use PID controllers for the platform @started(18-11-10 12:44) @done(18-11-10 13:18) @lasted(34m31s) @project(TODOs)
    The first one i want is one that rotates the robot to a certain heading and uses the compass as the feedback
  ✔ Test the new class implementation of the platform and the radio @done(18-11-10 11:25) @project(TODOs)
    The code compiles but is not tested
  ✔ Implement the GY-85 Magnetometer in a class @started(18-11-09 22:22) @done(18-11-09 22:22) @lasted(29s) @project(TODOs)
  ✔ Embedd the sensor data in a good way to be able to send it easy @started(18-11-09 21:22) @done(18-11-09 22:22) @lasted(1h44s) @project(TODOs)
    Should we send chars/int/double/float?
  ✔ Change motor handling so that it doesn't have to be driven with cppm @started(18-11-05 18:56) @done(18-11-06 19:11) @lasted(1d15m56s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that the motors can be driven in an easy way during autonomous drive
  ✔ Move the radio class into the platform @started(18-11-06 14:11) @done(18-11-06 18:57) @lasted(4h46m45s) @project(TODOs)
    The radio is right now separate using global variables
  ✔ Make the platform into a class @started(18-11-06 11:51) @done(18-11-06 12:34) @lasted(43m29s) @project(TODOs)
    This is so that we can store speed, direction etc in the class
